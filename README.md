# ReactNativeDiscountAppSample

A sample/ practice app created using React Native mainly to get hands on with React Native Animated Module (animations)

Used Animated Module to create animations like 
fading in, out,
spring animations,
animated items in parallel,
bounce, 
transition from one screen to another with custom screen interpolation

Made a few reusable components along the way like, 
Card View, 
Header view,
Custom List View that uses Card View to be used in FlatList component

Still the resuable components needs some refactoring and polishing, i would push changes to it regularly as i find time.
